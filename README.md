# Server Fleet Management Solution - A Work in Progress

## Project Overview
This repo contains our unfinished solution for the [2024 Ireland Tech Arena](https://huawei.agorize.com/en/challenges/irelandrc2024/pages/leaderboard?lang=en) competition, organized by Huawei. The challenge was about "Server Fleet Management At Scale," where we were supposed to come up with clever ways to manage server fleets effectively.

## Current Status
Honestly, we didn't finish it. We left the competition feeling pretty down about it, as None of us had enough time for it. The `nick_example` branch has some code that's supposed to train a PPO model to make decisions, but it's not working right. The model's not learning properly, the reward is always None or super negative, and it's just picking random numbers. üòí

## Why This Repo Exists
I'm not deleting this repo for now, even though I'm not proud of it. Here's why:
1. My teammates might want to look at it and maybe finish it someday (for learning, I guess).
2. It's an example of my projects for recruiters. I deleted a bunch of my other projects before because I thought they weren't good enough, and now I don't have much to show. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Development Notes
- We wrote this code with a lot of help from GPT during some really stressful nights (22:00 to 4:00).
- I kind of hate this project because of all those stressed-out nights...
- We were trying to use reinforcement learning (PPO), but it didn't work out like we hoped.

## Future Plans?
I'm not sure if I'll ever want to finish this. The whole experience was pretty frustrating. But if you're looking at this and have ideas, feel free to do whatever with it. I'm keeping it public for now.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to Huawei for organizing the competition, I guess. It was a learning experience, even if it wasn't the most fun one.

## Disclaimer
This project is a mess, to be honest. It's not a working solution for server fleet management. I'm just keeping it here as a record of what we tried to do.
